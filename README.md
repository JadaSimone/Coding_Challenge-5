# Coding_Challenge-5

## What is the Challenge?

Build an amazing company website and a chance to receive $500 for the winner.

This is good practice to work with not having complete information from the client and making decisions on your own based on “creative direction”. It is also a way for you to practice building professional company websites. The rest is up to you to research and figure out. Use this as a challenge to learn how to work with loose project requirements from a client, or go off on your own and create your dream company website. Just make sure you share it with the community. You can see the project requirements of the client here: 

Here is the old company website that they want to update: http://thrivingcities.com/
They said that they don't mind if some fields are left blank or with Lorem ipsum text so that things can be filled in later.

1) They have said that they don't care what it looks like. They just want it to look nice, interesting and be well commented.

2) The organization is really having a hard time coming up with a requirements document for this web project. They just want the company's website/logo and content from their older website. It seems like the organization doesn't know exactly what they want, but they want a web developer to help them figure it out. They want to see something creative and sleek, but they have no idea what they want it to look like. This could be a really great opportunity for you to be as unique and creative as they want to try to impress the client.

3) The website should have a Memphis, TN theme (where the company is located). Memphis is a city in Tennessee, USA. The events will be in Memphis, Tennessee, USA so it might be a good idea for you to have Memphis themes on the website (Elvis Presley, Martin Luther King Jr, Justin Timberlake, Lecrae, etc. People from Memphis, TN, USA basically.)

### The Rules Are:

1. You have until May 31st at 11:59pm EST to submit your website (using Github pages to put it online. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git+Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the #coding_challenge Discord group with the following message:  "Coding Challenge#5 Submission:<your link here> check it out @Andrei Neagoie". Submissions not following the above rules will not be judged. 

2. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own!

3. If the company likes your work, they will select the winner and they will pay $500 via paypal. If they select the winner, you will be in contact with @Briahna who will provide the payment details and communication with the client. 

**** Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I recieve from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge and prizes outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course as it helps with the ability to get prizes like these for you. 5 star reviews make my day :) *****
